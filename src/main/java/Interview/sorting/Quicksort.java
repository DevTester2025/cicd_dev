/**
 * Quicksort is another Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks one element of an array as the pivot and sorts all of the other elements around it,
 * for example smaller elements to the left, and larger to the right.
 * This guarantees that the pivot is in its proper place after the process. Then the algorithm recursively does the same for the left and
 * right portions of the array.
 * One of the reasons it is preferred to Merge Sort is that it doesn't take any extra space, all of the Interview.sorting is
 * done in-place, and there's no expensive allocation and deallocation calls
